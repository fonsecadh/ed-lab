# Review of the obtained data for the tests of the various algorithms with different complexities.

As we can observe in the chart, there is barely any difference between the results obtained in the linear algorithm compared with the results in the logarithmic algorithm. However, this is because *when represented against the times measured in the cubic and quadratic algorithms their difference is barely significant.*

If we see the results for the linear algorithm we clearly see a *exponential increase* of the numbers, while the data of the logarithmic algorithm *increases very lightly*, so we can see their differences more clearly than in the graph.
